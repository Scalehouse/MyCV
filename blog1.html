            <p class="blog--text">90% of startups fail, not because the idea was bad, but because they spent years building something nobody wanted. To avoid this trap, stop planning and start testing.<br><br>
              
            <strong>Here is your structure to get unstuck:</strong><br><br>

            <strong>1. Build a Tent, Not a Castle (The MVP)</strong> Don’t lock yourself in a cave for six months to build a perfect product. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—the simplest version of your idea. It could be a landing page, a sketch, or even a video like Dropbox used to verify interest before writing a line of code. You just need a signal that people care.<br><br>

            <strong>2. The Build-Measure-Learn Loop</strong> This is the heartbeat of your process. Build something small, measure how people use it, and learn from the results. Don't be the chef who bakes 100 cookies without letting anyone taste the first batch. Get feedback immediately.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Validate Your Assumptions</strong> Don’t just ask if the product works; ask why people are using it. You are testing human behavior. If users don't trust the site or don't value the feature, you need to know why immediately.<br><br>

            <strong>4. Pivot Without Ego</strong> If the data shows your solution isn't working, change direction. This is a "pivot"—shifting strategy while keeping the vision. Fall in love with the problem you are solving, not your specific solution.<br><br>

            <strong>5. Track Actionable Metrics Ignore</strong> "vanity metrics" like social media likes. Focus on numbers that help you make decisions: conversion rates (who buys?), retention (who stays?), and churn (who leaves?). If a number doesn't help you decide what to do next, ignore it.<br><br>

            <strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> Start small, listen to the data, and iterate fast. Don't build for perfection; build to learn.<br><br>
